The git repository and the 2 programs inside are set up to be tested locally on a windows machine.
Note: This means that the user is not propmted for input of IP address or port, and the system commands are the windows equivalent of Unix commands.

the named log files present are saved permantly for demonstration puposes.
"log.txt" is generated the first time the Client.java program is launched.
From then on, "log.txt" records the turn around time for each request the last ime the Client.java program ran.
